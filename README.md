My first coding project in python. There are plenty of these online, so this is more of a progress check than a unique tool. transV1 was made not long after I learned python, while transV2 was made just under a year later, after getting more experience in university electives, and messing around with code in my free time. 

The first sequence used in the selfTest file can be accredited A. Kalnins, K. Otto, U. Ruther and B. MuIller-Hill from their study 'Sequence of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli' (1983). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC555066/

The second sequence used doesn't really have to be accreddited to M. Nirnberg and J Matthaei, as it's just a homopolymer, but it was inspired by their study 'The dependence of cell-free protein synthesis in E. coli upon naturally occurring or synthetic polyribonucleotides' (1961). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC223178/pdf/pnas00214-0066.pdf
